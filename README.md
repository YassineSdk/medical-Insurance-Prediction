## medical-Insurance-Prediction
For this project, we are analyzing insurance data that includes information on whether an individual smokes or not, their sex, age, region, BMI, and the related insurance cost. Our main objective is to understand the relationship between the insurance cost and certain variables such as smoking habits, sex, age, region, and BMI. To achieve this, we will be building a model using Python language and the Sklearn library for model selection and construction. We will also be using Seaborn and Matplotlib for charting purposes, as well as Pandas and NumPy. Our first step will be to clean the data, followed by some exploratory analysis. After that, we will start building, evaluating, and optimizing our model to make it the best possible predictor.
